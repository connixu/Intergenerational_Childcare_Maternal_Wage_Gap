This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
r = getOption("repos")
r["CRAN"] = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"
options(repos = r)
install.packages("ggthemes") # Install 
library(ggthemes) # Load
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
install.packages("gridExtra")
library("gridExtra") 
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)
install.packages('plotly')
library(plotly)
install.packages('listviewer')
install.packages('gridExtra')
library(gridExtra)
```

```{r}
install.packages("pdftables")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
